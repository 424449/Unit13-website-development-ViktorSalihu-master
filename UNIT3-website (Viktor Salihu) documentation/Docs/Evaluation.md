The visitors were able to check any information for a specific product.
### Content
Other than phones the visitors enjoyed having more product like laptops and accessories, which all content was appropriate for business.
## Conclusion
The visitor was able to access and use the website with no issues at all.
# Why the website is suitable for the audience
The website is based for customers interested in buying technology, especially phones, but in the website can be found product like laptops, smart watches and earphones. It is easy navigable and fast loading.
# People with vision difficulties
The website is responsive and it can be zoomed, in that way the text enlarge itself and can be read by people with vision difficulties, also the webpage is not made with to many different colors because of colorblind people, I wanted to make it universal for everyone so the white is white and the grey will be grey in everyone's vision.
# Changes
## Button on "Contact Us" page 
The button on Contact us page was removed because was causing bug to the website, the goal was to make the website quick to load.
## Dropdown
The dropdown on the design was meant to be placed at the right end of the website, the dropdown was placed to the left end of the website displaying "All Products" That one benefited with the consistency of the webpage, the design was looking better.
## The button "buy"
The button buy at every product page was changed to "Buy for (price)" displaying above the button the name of the product on the top of the name was placed the logo of the company, this was beneficial because it was a creative way to put the price on.
## Logo 
The logo on the header of the page was removed, it was beneficial to the responsiveness of the webpage, because of the logo the page was having difficulties with making the page actually smaller.
# Solutions I have done
Because the page was unresponsive for unknown reason, when I was trying to minimize or zoom into the page, the page was getting wider, so you can scroll sideways, I figured out what was the issue and that was the logo on the header of the document, I have removed it so my page can be responsive.
# How the design will fulfil the purpose, user requirements and constraints.
The design is simply made and avoided too many colors which can cause confuse and struggle to read the text. Although the website is designed with only two colors which are white and grey, with only one font text and easy navigable structure of the pages, the customer can go back to the home page fast and easy with provided button on the page.
# Feedback
Here are my feedback gave by my two classmates, the task is to collect some feedback from from two or more of other people. They have to check it functionality and criticize it.
|No.|Name|Feedback|
|---|------:|-------|
|1|Vasil|The page looks alright but you could add a bulky look to the navigation buttons, so they can look like actual button because now they look like links, the page is a little bit empty because it has no background pictures.
|2|Armandas|It misses some details to the logo when you buy a phone from the website, the picture looks squashed, you can also putting more information in about us section.
# Further improvements after feedback
Changes that can be added after finishing will be more advanced editing on the product pages, I don't like how basic they look, I can edit the whole structure of the page because I don't like how the pictures are spread through the sides of the page. Also the page when you click to buy a product is so empty, I can add more stuff to it like pictures, more buttons for different pages, suggestions and more like this so the page will look better and professional.
# Changes made after the feedback
The feedback of Vasil informed me that I have to create bulky buttons for the website, although I liked them like this, because it was not adding any additional graphics that are without purpose.
The feedback of Armandas informed me that the logo was it bad quality, after a bit of struggle I finally did succeed and I improved the quality of the logo.
