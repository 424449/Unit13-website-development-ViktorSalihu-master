# Design Notes
+ This document explains information about: Layout, such as sizes and positions. Typography (fonts, font sizes, font colors)
# Wireframes
+ I used to have issues with inserting the wireframes pictures in documentation file, you can find them in the folder named "WIREFRAME"
# Task
+ For this task I have been asked to create two designs for my website, the first must be a main one and the second will be an alternative.
+ The design of the website: layout.
+ What fonts are used for the website, what size and color.
+ Background color.
# Why alternative design was rejected
The alternative page named Design 2 was rejected because it was looking too buffy. In order to make the page easy navigable was to keep it simple. Design 1 was chosen because it is simpler and nice to use, also was easier for the designer to create it so it saved time.
# Strengths and Weaknesses
+ The strengths of the website are the detail the designer have put on it, the pictures that are on sale are with a label on the left side, all the products that are on sale can be found in a single page. The iPhone 12 pro page has more details than the other pages, it has a video, you cant buy the phone without selecting a storage for the phone.
+ The weaknesses are the buttons, the navigation buttons are not designed very well, the designer didn't put that much work because the goal was to be functional and not pretty.
The fonts are not creative enough.

# How the final website is suitable for the intended audience and purpose.
+ The final website is suitable for any kind of audience, it is professionally made with simple short text that explains the purpose of it. The website can be used from people with visibility issues like colorblindness just because the website design avoids the multiple bright colors like red, orange or green , the website is in universal color grey.

# Updates
## Product Page
+ Instead of one picture for product, they have been changed to two.
+ Every single product has a table explaining specifications.
## Contact Us Page
